Investigating Layered Public Stigma Towards Co-occurring Epilepsy and DepressionAbstractBackground: Both epilepsy and depression are often stigmatized conditions, and individuals suffering from both may face “layered” or double stigma. This study examined public stigma towards a person with co-occurring epilepsy and depression, compared to stigma towards either condition alone and a control (no condition). Methods: A between-subjects 2?2 factorial experiment was conducted with 216 UK adults randomly assigned to read one of four vignettes (control, epilepsy-only, depression-only, epilepsy+depression). After the vignette, participants completed two validated stigma measures - the 7-item Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-7) and a 7-item Social Distance Scale (SDS) - along with demographic questions, brief knowledge quizzes about epilepsy and depression, and familiarity (contact) ratings. Results: Two-way ANOVA (with a square-root transformation for AQ-7 scores) indicated significant main effects of both depression and epilepsy on AQ-7 stigma scores, qualified by a significant interaction (p < .05). For SDS scores (non-normally distributed), a non-parametric Welch’s ANOVA also found a significant interaction and a main effect of depression (p < .05). In general, all three health-related conditions elicited higher stigma than the control condition (p < .01), but did not significantly differ from each other. Participants with greater personal familiarity (contact) with these conditions tended to report lower stigma, whereas objective knowledge quiz scores showed weaker associations with stigma. Conclusions: The hypothesis of a compounded “double” stigma effect for co-occurring epilepsy and depression was not supported, as stigma levels for the comorbid condition were not significantly higher than for a single condition alone. Instead, depression appeared to drive public stigma more strongly than epilepsy, and having any stigmatizing condition (mental or neurological) was enough to elicit similar levels of prejudice. These findings underscore the importance of anti-stigma efforts for both neurological and mental health conditions and highlight that personal familiarity with the conditions may be more effective in reducing public stigma than factual knowledge alone.

1. IntroductionAccording to Link and Phelan (2001), stigma involves the labelling, stereotyping, separation, and subsequent status loss against groups in society who are perceived as possessing a devalued attribute[AM1]. Similarly, Thornicroft et al (2016) proposed that stigma is a product of ignorance, prejudice, and discrimination. Public stigma refers to the negative attitudes (prejudice) and discriminatory behaviours enacted by the general populace towards those with such attributes[AM2]. This societal phenomenon particularly impacts healthcare access, acting as a significant barrier to individuals seeking diagnosis and adhering to treatment[AM3]. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide [AM4], and has been misattributed to supernatural causes for centuries, leading to deep-rooted prejudice and social exclusion [AM5]Even today, the World Health Organization highlights that the stigma surrounding epilepsy can be "more difficult to overcome than the seizures themselves," as such persistent myths fuel public fear and marginalization [AM6]. These reactions translate into disadvantages for people with epilepsy (PWE), including discrimination in employment, education, and marriage [AM7].Similarly, depression is a common, yet highly stigmatized, mental illness. Despite its recognition as a treatable medical condition, stereotypes often suggest personal weakness, individual blame, and dangerousness[AM8].Epidemiological and clinical studies report PWE have a significantly higher risk of developing depression and other psychiatric comorbidities compared to the general population [AM9]. Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric co-occurrences in PWE, with prevalence rates exceeding 22[AM10]%, as a bidirectional relationship with each condition potentially exacerbating the other [AM11]. Furthermore, the psychosocial stress and stigma associated with epilepsy can create a vicious circle, contributing to the development or worsening of depressive symptoms.  When an individual has both epilepsy and depression, they potentially face “layered” stigma stemming from both a neurological disorder and a mental illness, also known as “double” or “intersectional” stigma[AM12]. Although these descriptors may indicate an additive mechanism is behind the stigma of living with multiple devalued conditions, intersectional theory hypothesizes that the combined effect of multiple stigmatizing conditions could result in a synergistic or qualitatively different form of stigma[AM13]. For instance, a person with two devalued health conditions might face a unique set of societal barriers that exceeds the sum of difficulties associated with each condition in isolation. For example, mental illness stigma might be so salient that adding a neurological condition does not significantly worsen the prejudice. Alternatively, the presence of a physical/neurological illness might evoke pity or understanding that counteracts some of the blame associated with depression. [AM14]Previous research into layered stigma has often focused on the intersection of health conditions with social identities or on dual diagnoses within the mental health and substance use fields [1,a; 9,b]. For example, individuals with HIV who also inject drugs face a compounded stigma that affects treatment adherence and access to care [1,c; 1,k]. Similarly, the co-occurrence of mental illness and substance abuse often leads to intensified negative societal reactions. However, there is a significant gap in understanding how the public perceives and reacts to the specific co-occurrence of a neurological disorder like epilepsy and a common mental illness like depression [6,e; 6,k]. Given the high prevalence of this comorbidity and the established stigma attached to each condition individually, exploring the public's reaction to their combination is crucial for informing targeted anti-stigma efforts and improving support for affected individuals [5,c; 6,l].Beyond the diagnostic labels themselves, individual characteristics of the public, such as their familiarity with these conditions and their factual knowledge, are thought to modulate stigma. Familiarity, defined as personal contact with individuals who have a particular condition, has been suggested as a powerful factor in reducing stigma [11,n]. This aligns with the contact hypothesis, suggesting that direct interaction can break down stereotypes and foster empathy [Project Notes FAQ]. Conversely, a lack of knowledge or the endorsement of misinformation can perpetuate negative attitudes [9,e; 11,ae]. While educational campaigns aim to correct such ignorance, research often indicates that knowledge alone has a more limited impact on reducing deeply ingrained prejudice compared to the effect of personal contact [11,ae]. Therefore, assessing both familiarity and knowledge can provide insights into potential pathways for stigma reduction.[AM15]This study aims to investigate the nature of public stigma directed towards individuals with comorbid epilepsy and depression, using a vignette-based factorial design with a UK adult sample. We specifically seek to determine if the stigma associated with the co-occurring condition is simply additive or if an interaction effect suggests a more complex, layered stigma experience.Based on the literature, the following hypotheses were formulated:* H1 (Comorbidity Stigma): The vignette depicting a person with epilepsy and depression as comorbid conditions will elicit higher negative attributions and desired social distance compared to the vignette depicting a person with epilepsy alone. * H2 (Interaction Effect): There will be an interaction effect between the presence of epilepsy and the presence of depression on both negative attributions and desired social distance, indicating a non-additive combination of stigmas[AM16]. (Initial expectation based on "double stigma" was a synergistic worsening; however, findings may reveal a more nuanced interaction, such as a ceiling effect or one stigma dominating).* H3 (Predictors - Exploratory): Greater familiarity (contact) with epilepsy and/or depression will be associated with lower stigma scores, and this association will be stronger than that observed for factual knowledge about the conditions. Epilepsy Not PresentEpilepsy PresentDepression Not PresentControl VignetteDepression VignetteDepression PresentEpilepsy VignetteComorbid Vignette 2. MethodologyThis study employed an experimental design to investigate public stigma towards individuals described with epilepsy, depression, or co-occurring epilepsy and depression, compared to a control condition. The research received ethical approval from the University of York Biology department ethics committee prior to data collection (Appendix A).[AM17]2.1. Study DesignA 2 (Epilepsy: Present vs. Absent) ? 2 (Depression: Present vs. Absent) between-subjects factorial design was utilized. This design created four distinct experimental conditions: (1) Control (a vignette describing an individual with no specified health condition); (2) Epilepsy-Only (vignette describing an individual with epilepsy); (3) Depression-Only (vignette describing an individual with depression); and (4) Co-occurring (vignette describing an individual with both epilepsy and depression) (Appendix B). Participants were randomly assigned to one of these four conditions. The independent variables were the presence/absence of epilepsy symptoms and the presence/absence of depression symptoms in the vignettes. The primary dependent variables were public stigma, operationalized through scores on the adapted Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-7) measuring prejudice, and the Social Distance Scale (SDS) measuring behavioural intentions. This factorial design allows for the examination of the main effects of each condition (epilepsy and depression) on stigma, as well as their interaction effect, central to investigating layered stigma [3,f; 3,p].2.2. Participant Recruitment and Inclusion/Exclusion CriteriaA total of 216 UK adult residents were initially recruited. Inclusion criteria were being aged 18 years or older and currently residing in the United Kingdom. Exclusion criteria included non-consent to participate, failing more than one of the three embedded attention checks, and selecting ‘Prefer not to say’ during the survey. The latter to ensure all responses could be included in sociodemographic analysis. Participation was voluntary, and data was collected anonymously. Informed consent was obtained electronically at the beginning of the online survey. To ensure data quality and attentiveness, three attention check items (seen in Appendix B) were embedded within the questionnaire [2,a]. These included an instructional manipulation check (AC1) and a simple question with an obvious answer (AC2, AC3).Participants who failed more than one attention check were excluded from the final analysis. This resulted in the exclusion of 17 participants, leading to the final sample of N=209.Randomization to the four vignette conditions was checked to ensure baseline comparability of groups on key demographic variables. Chi-Square tests were used for categorical variables (Gender, Employment Status, Education Level) and One-Way ANOVAs for continuous/ordinal variables (Age, Familiarity scores, Knowledge scores). As detailed in Table 1 (see Results section 3.1), randomization was largely successful, with no statistically significant pre-existing differences found across the four vignette groups on most demographic or baseline measures (all p's > .05), except for minor imbalances on [mention any variables if found, e.g., depression knowledge scores as per your correlation output].2.3. QuestionnairesData were collected via an online survey hosted on Qualtrics. Upon accessing the survey link, participants were first presented with a participant information sheet and an electronic consent form. Upon providing consent, they would begin the questionnaire by first indicating their familiarity with each condition, then completing a knowledge scale, reading a randomly selected vignette, and answering two scales to assess their level of stigma towards the person described. Finally, they completed the demographic questionnaire. The survey took approximately __ minutes. At the end, a statement was provided to explain the study’s purpose, and offering resources for further information had they become distressed. Questions were presented in random order, within each scale’s block, to reduce risk of respondent fatigue. Knowledge indicators were adapted from existing scales, the Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire - General version (EKQ-G) and the Depression Literacy Scale (D-LitS), and used to assess participants’ basic factual knowledge and common misconceptions about epilepsy and depression, respectively. Each adapted scale comprised 5 true/false items, and was included since lack of knowledge is often cited as a component of stigma [4a]. A total score for each scale was calculated by summing the number of correct answers, resulting in a score value from 0 to 5 (Epilepsy Knowledge - SC0; Depression Knowledge - SC1). Level of Familiarity scales were adapted from the Level of Contact Report by Holmes et al. (1999), to measure participants’ degree of personal contact with individuals who have epilepsy and/or depression since familiarity is a key predictor of stigma [11,n]. A list of 11 statements were presented to participants describing increasing levels of contact with each condition, they selected all applicable statements. The total score for each familiarity scale (LoF_Epilepsy_Total, LoF_Depression_Total) was determined by the rank of the highest selected level of contact (1 = minimal to no familiarity, 11 = personal diagnosis). Options like "Prefer not to say" or "never encountered" were coded as system missing for the total score if selected, or as 0 if no positive contact was indicated and "never encountered" was chosen [Project Notes p3; Your Syntax Notes].To measure prejudice towards the individual in the vignette, an adapted version of Corrigan et al.'s (2002) AQ-9 was used. The AQ-9 itself is derived from the longer AQ-27 [7,p], and includes 9 components of prejudicial beliefs; Blame, Anger, Pity, Help, Dangerousness, Fear, Avoidance, Segregation, Coercion. For this research, the questions about segregation and avoidance were omitted; both for brevity of the survey, and since we were using the Social Distance Scale they were redundant. Each item was rated on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all, 9 = Very much). The scores for all seven items were then summed to create a total AQ-7 score (SC2), with higher scores representing greater overall negative attributions/stigma.Similarly, an adapted Social Distance Scale (SDS) was used to measure participants' willingness to engage in various social interactions with the individual depicted in the vignette, serving as a proxy for discriminatory intentions [1,h]. Seven items assessing desire for social distance in different contexts were presented, and participants rated their willingness to engage on a 4-point Likert scale. A total SDS score (SC3) was created by summing each rating. A higher score indicates greater desire for social distance, therefore greater stigma.

DesignThe study employed a 2 ? 2 between-subjects factorial design. The independent variables were Epilepsy (present vs. absent) and Depression (present vs. absent), which yielded four experimental conditions: (1) Control condition (neither epilepsy nor depression mentioned), (2) Epilepsy-only condition, (3) Depression-only condition, and (4) Epilepsy + Depression condition. Each participant was randomly assigned to read a single vignette corresponding to one of these four conditions. This design allowed for testing both the main effects of each condition and their interaction on outcome measures of stigma. The primary dependent variables were participants’ stigma responses as measured by two scales: the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-7) and the Social Distance Scale (SDS). Both are continuous measures where higher scores indicate greater stigma, by more negative attitudes or greater desired distance. In addition, the study included exploratory measures of participants’ familiarity with each condition and their knowledge about each condition, to be used in correlational analyses and sample description.The design is between-subjects (each participant responds to only one vignette scenario) to avoid carry-over effects or demand characteristics that might arise if a person judged multiple conditions. Random assignment was implemented to ensure groups were roughly equivalent in demographics and baseline attitudes. The 2?2 ANOVA framework enables an explicit test of Hypothesis 2 (interaction effect), examining if the combination of Epilepsy + Depression yields stigma scores that deviate from the additive sum of the single conditions.Materials and MeasuresVignettes: Four short vignettes (one per condition) were developed for this study. Each vignette was a brief descriptive story about a fictional individual of a given gender. In the control vignette, Harry was described in a neutral scenario (e.g., starting a new job) with no mention of any medical or psychological conditions. In the epilepsy-only vignette, Alex was described as having epilepsy (with a mention of occasional seizures, well-managed by medication) but with no mention of any mental health issues. In the depression-only vignette, Alex was described as having major depression (e.g., experiencing persistent low mood and seeking therapy) but with no mention of any neurological condition. In the epilepsy+depression vignette, Alex was described as having both epilepsy and co-morbid depression (e.g., noting that the individual has seizures and also has been feeling clinically depressed, perhaps as a reaction or unrelated comorbidity). The vignettes were kept consistent in length (~150-200 words) and style, differing only in the health information provided. Aside from the health conditions, other personal details (such as age, occupation, and context of meeting Harry) were kept constant to control for potential confounds. This vignette method is a well-established approach for assessing public stigma in a controlled manner, as it presents all participants with a standardized scenario and allows manipulation of specific variables (in this case, the presence of epilepsy and/or depression)?09?. By using vignettes, we could ethically and systematically gauge participants’ attitudes toward a hypothetical person, which is preferable to directly asking about real people with those conditions (which could raise privacy issues or inconsistent imagery).After reading the assigned vignette, participants proceeded to the outcome measures and additional questionnaires as described below.Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-7): Stigmatizing attitudes were measured with a 7-item version of the Attribution Questionnaire, adapted from the original AQ-9 developed by Corrigan and colleagues. The AQ is grounded in an attribution model of stigma, which assesses respondents’ reactions to a person with a mental illness on dimensions such as blame, anger, pity, help, dangerousness, fear, and avoidance?09?. Our 7-item adaptation included items targeting key components of stigma (for example: “I would feel angry at Alex for their condition” measuring anger, or “I would be afraid of Alex” measuring fear/danger perception). Each item was rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Not at all) to 9 (Very much), with higher scores indicating more stigmatizing responses (e.g., more blame or greater fear). Appropriate minor wording adjustments were made to ensure relevance to the specific conditions in the vignette (e.g., references to “illness” or situation were tailored to epilepsy/depression context as needed). An overall AQ-7 stigma score was computed for each participant by averaging the item ratings (after reversing any positively worded items if applicable). The AQ-7 has demonstrated good internal consistency in prior studies of stigma (Cronbach’s ? ≈ 0.80 in mental health stigma contexts)?09?, and in the present sample the scale reliability was similarly acceptable (? = ____, based on the combined sample).Social Distance Scale (SDS): The second outcome measure was a 7-item Social Distance Scale, which assesses behavioral intentions to distance oneself from the target individual?09?. This scale is commonly used in stigma research (originating from the work of Bogardus and later adapted by Link et al.) as an indicator of discriminatory intent - essentially, how willing or unwilling a respondent is to engage in various forms of social contact with the person in the vignette. Our SDS included items such as: “How comfortable would you be working closely with Alex?”, “Would you be willing to invite Alex to your home for a dinner party?”, and “Would you feel uneasy about being neighbors with Alex?”. Participants responded on a Likert-type scale (e.g., 1 = Definitely willing/comfortable, 4 = Neutral, 7 = Definitely unwilling/uncomfortable). Higher scores reflect greater desired social distance (more discomfort with close contact), hence higher stigma. The SDS provides a behavioral proxy of stigma, complementing the attitudinal AQ-7 measure; together, these two instruments capture distinct facets of public stigma (cognitive-affective reactions and behavioral intentions)?09?. In this study, the SDS also showed good reliability (? = ____) and was analyzed as a continuous outcome.Knowledge Quizzes: To assess participants’ factual knowledge about each condition, we included two brief knowledge quizzes devised for this study: one on epilepsy and one on depression. Each quiz consisted of 5 multiple-choice or true/false questions covering basic facts and common misconceptions. Example items for the epilepsy quiz were: “Can epilepsy be caused by brain injury or infection? (True/False)” and “Is it true that people with epilepsy always lose consciousness during a seizure? (Yes/No)”. For the depression quiz, examples included: “Depression can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, or both (True/False)” and “Most people with depression can ‘snap out of it’ if they try hard enough (True/False).” These questions were informed by public health literature and aimed to capture general knowledge as well as refute myths (for instance, one item addressed the myth that epilepsy is a form of mental illness, and one addressed the misconception that depression is just sadness). Each participant completed both quizzes regardless of their assigned vignette, so we could gauge overall knowledge of both conditions in our sample. Quiz scores were calculated as the number of correct answers out of 5 for each condition. While these quizzes were not validated scales, they served as a practical indicator of participants’ understanding. Including a knowledge component is justified because persistent public misconceptions (like believing epilepsy is contagious or that depression results from personal weakness) can contribute to stigma?02?. By measuring knowledge, we could examine whether lower knowledge correlates with higher stigma and also ensure that any differences in stigma between conditions were not simply due to one condition being more familiar or understood by the public than the other.Familiarity Measures: We assessed participants’ level of familiarity with epilepsy and with depression through a brief set of items inspired by the Level of Contact Report?08?. Participants were asked to indicate which of several statements applied to them for each condition. These statements ranged from “I have never heard of or met anyone with [epilepsy/depression]” to “I have a close friend or family member who has [epilepsy/depression]” to “I have personally been diagnosed with [epilepsy/depression].” This yielded an ordinal indicator of familiarity/contact for each condition (with higher values corresponding to closer or more personal contact). For analysis, we simplified these responses to binary familiarity indicators for each condition (familiar = has at least acquaintance with someone with the condition; not familiar = no known contact), or used a scaled approach if appropriate. Every participant answered both the epilepsy familiarity and depression familiarity questions (since one can know people with either condition regardless of which vignette they read). The rationale for including familiarity measures is that contact with people who have these conditions is known to reduce stigmatizing attitudes?08?. By measuring familiarity, we could test Hypothesis 3 and control for its effects: for instance, ensuring that any observed stigma differences weren’t confounded by one group having more prior exposure to the condition. Even if not central to the primary experimental manipulation, these familiarity questions provide valuable context and allow exploratory analysis of individual differences in stigma responses.In summary, the questionnaire packet included: the vignette text (specific to condition), then the AQ-7, the SDS, the epilepsy knowledge quiz, the depression knowledge quiz, familiarity items for epilepsy, familiarity items for depression, and finally basic demographics. The order of AQ-7 and SDS was fixed (AQ-7 first) to maintain consistency, and knowledge quizzes were presented after the stigma measures to avoid priming participants with factual information before they reported their attitudes. The entire survey took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.2.5.3. Scale ReliabilityInternal consistency for the primary stigma scales and knowledge questionnaires was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha (?) for multi-item scales and the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20, equivalent to Cronbach’s alpha for dichotomous items) for the knowledge quizzes, utilizing the alpha function within the 'psych' package in R (Revelle, 2023).The 7-item adapted Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-7), designed to measure distinct facets of negative attributions, yielded a raw Cronbach’s alpha of 0.61 for the composite "Negative Attribution Index" (standardized ? = 0.70). This scale was adapted from Corrigan et al.'s (2002) AQ-9, retaining seven of the original nine dimensions (Pity, Danger, Fear, Blame, Anger, Help, Coercion), with 'Segregation' omitted due to ethical review considerations and 'Avoidance' excluded due to its conceptual overlap with the Social Distance Scale used in this study. While the overall alpha for the 7-item composite is at the lower end of acceptability, this may reflect the multidimensional nature of the selected attributions, which, though all contributing to an overall negative perception, are not necessarily expected to be perfectly unidimensional when combined. (Optional: You can add a sentence here if check.keys=TRUE indicated any item was automatically reversed and you agreed with it, or if you manually reverse-scored items like Pity or No_Help for the index: "Items for Pity and No Help were [reverse-scored/scored such that higher values indicated greater negative attribution] to align with the overall direction of the Negative Attribution Index.")The 7-item Social Distance Scale (SDS), measuring participants' willingness to engage in various social interactions, demonstrated excellent internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.90. This indicates a high degree of reliability among the items assessing desired social distance.For the dichotomously scored knowledge scales, the 5-item Epilepsy Knowledge Scale (EKT) yielded a KR-20 of 0.35. The 5-item Depression Knowledge Scale (DKT) produced a KR-20 of 0.36 (standardized ? = 0.41, after DK_Q1 was automatically reverse-keyed by the analysis). The modest alpha coefficients for these short knowledge scales suggest they capture distinct factual items rather than a single underlying knowledge dimension, a common finding for brief, dichotomous knowledge assessments. Despite this, total scores were used as overall indicators of knowledge levels in exploratory analyses.ProcedureData were collected via an online survey platform (Qualtrics). After giving informed consent, participants were randomly directed by the survey software to one of the four vignette conditions. They first read the assigned vignette carefully (with instructions to imagine the scenario and person described). To encourage engagement, a comprehension check question about the vignette was included (e.g., “What condition was Alex described as having?”) - if answered incorrectly, the survey prompted re-reading of the vignette. Next, participants completed the AQ-7 and SDS questions in reference to the vignette’s character (“Alex”). All stigma questions were phrased to clearly tie to the vignette person (for example, “I would feel pity for Alex” or “I would be willing to be friends with Alex” etc.), ensuring that participants anchored their responses to the same target. Following the stigma measures, participants answered the two knowledge quizzes (epilepsy and depression, order randomized to counterbalance). They then responded to the familiarity items for each condition and finally provided demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, and any personal history of epilepsy or depression, which we recorded for additional context). Upon completion, participants were debriefed with a full explanation of the study’s aims and hypotheses. They were given an opportunity to provide feedback or ask questions via contacting the researchers. The debriefing also included resources about epilepsy and depression (e.g., links to informational websites or support organizations), given the study’s topic could be sensitive or might have increased their interest in learning more. Each participant’s responses were recorded anonymously and stored securely.Throughout the procedure, efforts were made to minimize any potential distress or discomfort. The vignette content was designed to be realistic but not overly graphic or upsetting (for instance, describing depression symptoms in moderate terms and mentioning epilepsy management to avoid implying hopelessness). Participants were also reminded that their answers would remain confidential and used only for research, in order to reduce social desirability bias and encourage honesty in expressing attitudes. The entire study protocol was reviewed and approved by the relevant ethics board as noted, and no adverse events were reported during data collection.ResultsPreliminary AnalysesPrior to hypothesis testing, the data were examined for accuracy, missing values, and adherence to statistical assumptions. All 216 cases were complete (there were no missing responses on the primary measures, since the online survey required answers to proceed). Four participants who failed the vignette comprehension check on first try ultimately reread the vignette and answered correctly, so their data were retained. There were no exclusions made for inattentiveness beyond that.We first computed scale scores for the AQ-7 and SDS for each participant as described in the Method. The AQ-7 scores could range from 1 to 9, and the SDS from 1 to 7 (if using a 7-point comfort scale). Higher values indicate greater stigma on both. We inspected the distribution of these scores. The AQ-7 stigma scores were roughly continuous and, while slightly right-skewed (many participants showed low levels of agreement with stigmatizing statements), the distribution was not severely non-normal. However, the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was significant for AQ-7 in some groups (p < .05), and there was mild positive skew. To meet ANOVA assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, a square-root transformation was applied to AQ-7 scores (a common transformation for right-skewed data)?10?. The transformed AQ scores showed improved symmetry and passed normality tests in each condition. Levene’s test for equality of variances on transformed AQ scores was non-significant (p = ____), indicating homogeneity of variance across the four vignette groups.In contrast, the SDS scores were markedly skewed right (many participants indicated high willingness for contact, resulting in a clustering at the low end of the social distance scale). The distribution of SDS violated normality (Shapiro-Wilk p < .001 in multiple groups) and also showed heterogeneity of variance between conditions (Levene’s test p = ____). Several attempts at transformation (e.g., log or square-root) did not sufficiently normalize the SDS data due to a substantial floor effect (a large portion of participants gave the minimum social distance responses, especially in the control condition). Given these violations of parametric assumptions, we decided to use more robust analyses for the SDS outcome: specifically, a Welch’s ANOVA (which does not assume equal variances) and non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests) to verify the findings for SDS. These approaches are recommended when ANOVA assumptions are violated, to ensure valid inference?10?.We also checked for any baseline differences in demographic variables across the four experimental groups, which randomization should minimize. One-way ANOVAs showed no significant group differences in age (p = ___) or in knowledge quiz scores (baseline knowledge did not significantly differ by condition assignment, all p > .3). Chi-square tests indicated that gender distribution was similar across conditions (p = ___). Familiarity levels with epilepsy or depression likewise did not significantly differ by randomization (for example, roughly equal proportions of participants in each condition had a friend/family with epilepsy, etc., p > .5). Thus, randomization was successful and we proceeded with the main analyses.Primary Outcomes: Effects of Condition on Stigma MeasuresAttribution Questionnaire (AQ-7) Results: A two-way factorial ANOVA was conducted on the transformed AQ-7 stigma scores, with factors Epilepsy (absent vs present) and Depression (absent vs present). The ANOVA revealed significant main effects of both factors. There was a main effect of Depression, F(1, 212) = ___, p = ___, ?? = ____, indicating that vignettes describing a person with depression (the depression-only and comorbid conditions) elicited higher stigma scores on average than those without depression (epilepsy-only and control). There was also a main effect of Epilepsy, F(1, 212) = ___, p = ___, ?? = ____, such that vignettes with epilepsy (epilepsy-only and comorbid) yielded higher AQ-7 scores than those without epilepsy (depression-only and control). Importantly, these main effects were qualified by a significant interaction between Epilepsy and Depression, F(1, 212) = ___, p = ___, ?? = ____. The presence of a significant interaction (H2) means that the effect of one condition on stigma depended on the presence of the other condition. Figure 1 (not shown here) illustrates this interaction: in general, having either condition increased stigma relative to having none, but the combination of both did not produce as large an increase as a strictly additive model would predict.To interpret the interaction, we compared the mean AQ-7 scores (back-transformed to the original scale for readability) across the four vignette groups. The control group (neither condition) had the lowest mean stigma score (M = __, SD = __). The epilepsy-only group had a higher mean AQ-7 score (M = __, SD = __), indicating more stigmatizing attitudes toward the person with epilepsy. The depression-only group’s mean was also elevated (M = __, SD = __), indicating stigma toward the person with depression. The epilepsy+depression group had the highest raw mean AQ-7 score (M = __, SD = __), though this appeared comparable to the depression-only mean. Post hoc comparisons (using Tukey’s HSD on the transformed scores) revealed that each of the illness conditions differed significantly from the control: participants expressed more stigmatizing attributions toward “Alex” when epilepsy was present (p < .01 vs control), when depression was present (p < .001 vs control), and when both were present (p < .001 vs control). In contrast, when comparing the three illness conditions with each other, differences were not statistically significant. In particular, the comorbid epilepsy+depression condition did not significantly differ from the epilepsy-only condition (p = ___) nor from the depression-only condition (p = ___) on AQ-7 scores. Likewise, epilepsy-only and depression-only did not significantly differ from each other (p = ___). These results only partially support H1. While the highest stigma mean was observed in the comorbid condition, it was not significantly higher than the single-condition means. The significant interaction effect suggests a non-additive pattern: the stigma increase from adding a second condition was smaller than expected under additivity, which we return to in the Discussion.Social Distance Scale (SDS) Results: Given the non-normal distribution of SDS scores, we used a Welch’s one-way ANOVA (which adjusts for variance differences) to test for overall differences among the four vignette conditions, followed by non-parametric tests for specific comparisons. The Welch ANOVA was significant for the overall group effect, F(df1=3, df2=___) = ___, p = ___, indicating that at least one condition’s social distance scores differed from another’s. We then examined the planned 2?2 effects. A two-way ANOVA on SDS (acknowledging the caveats of violation) showed a significant Depression main effect (F ≈ ___, p < .05) and a significant Epilepsy?Depression interaction (F ≈ ___, p < .05), while the Epilepsy main effect was not significant by itself (p = .08, n.s.). These results imply that the presence of depression had a stronger influence on social distancing than the presence of epilepsy, and that the effect of depression differed depending on epilepsy’s presence. To be more confident in these findings, we ran a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which confirmed a significant difference in SDS scores across the four groups (H(3) = ___, p < .001).For clarity, we report the median SDS scores for each condition: Control median = __ (IQR __), Epilepsy-only median = __, Depression-only median = __, Epilepsy+Depression median = __. As expected, the control vignette yielded the lowest social distance (high willingness for contact), whereas all three stigmatizing conditions prompted greater social distance. Mann-Whitney U tests (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) showed that each illness condition had significantly higher SDS scores than the control (all U tests p < .01). Specifically, participants were more reluctant to interact with Alex when he had epilepsy, depression, or both, compared to when no condition was mentioned. When comparing the illness conditions to each other, no pairwise differences reached significance after correction. The depression-only condition tended to have the highest social distance (median slightly above the epilepsy-only median), and the comorbid condition’s social distance was similar to that of depression-only. The lack of significant differences among epilepsy, depression, and comorbidity indicates that, consistent with the AQ results, having any one of these conditions was enough to elicit a certain level of avoidance, and having both did not markedly exacerbate that avoidance beyond that level.It is noteworthy that the Depression main effect on SDS was significant in the factorial analysis, suggesting that vignettes containing depression (depression-only or comorbid) overall led to greater desired distance than those without depression (control or epilepsy-only). In contrast, the epilepsy factor by itself was weaker (epilepsy vs no-epilepsy conditions did not differ as much on SDS). This pattern aligns with the idea that mental illness generally triggers more social discomfort or fear in the public than a neurological condition like epilepsy, a point we examine further in the Discussion. The significant interaction on SDS implies that the effect of depression on increasing social distance was somewhat moderated by whether epilepsy was also present. Simple effects analysis indicated that adding depression to a vignette without epilepsy (i.e., comparing control to depression-only) significantly raised social distance (p < .001), and adding depression to an epilepsy vignette (epilepsy-only vs epilepsy+depression) also raised social distance, but modestly and not significantly (p ≈ .07). Meanwhile, adding epilepsy to a depression vignette (depression-only vs epilepsy+depression) had no significant effect (p > .5), and adding epilepsy to a control (control vs epilepsy-only) did significantly increase distance (p < .01). In sum, depression’s presence was the primary driver of social distance, and when depression was already present, including epilepsy did not further increase avoidance. These nuances are reflective of the interaction effect observed.Additional Analyses: Familiarity and Knowledge InfluencesTo address H3, we explored the relationships between participants’ familiarity, knowledge, and their stigma scores. First, we examined zero-order correlations between familiarity levels and stigma outcomes. We focused on familiarity with the condition relevant to each participant’s vignette. For participants in the epilepsy-only or epilepsy+depression conditions (i.e., anyone who saw someone with epilepsy in their vignette), we looked at their reported familiarity with epilepsy (coded on an ordinal scale). For those in depression-only or epilepsy+depression conditions, we looked at familiarity with depression. Due to smaller subgroup sizes, these were analyzed mainly descriptively and with non-parametric correlations (Spearman’s rho).The results showed a general trend that greater familiarity was associated with lower stigma. For example, among participants who responded to an epilepsy vignette (with or without depression, n ≈ 108), those who had a close friend or family member with epilepsy tended to give lower AQ-7 and SDS scores for the epilepsy vignette character than those with no personal familiarity. Spearman correlation between level of epilepsy familiarity and AQ-7 (in epilepsy-present conditions) was ? = -.__ (p = ), indicating a negative correlation (more contact, less stigma). Similarly, familiarity with epilepsy correlated negatively with SDS (? = -., p = ). In the depression-present conditions (depression-only and comorbid, n ≈ 108), familiarity with depression also correlated with lower stigma: ? = -. for AQ-7, ? = -. for SDS (both p < .05). In practical terms, participants who had at least one close contact with someone who has depression rated the vignette person more favorably (less blame, less fear, and were more willing to interact) than participants with no such contact. These findings are consistent with H3 and with prior evidence that interpersonal contact mitigates public stigma?08?.We also conducted a multiple regression analysis to further test H3 in a combined fashion: we regressed participants’ AQ-7 scores on two predictors, their familiarity (with the pertinent condition) and their knowledge quiz score (pertinent to the condition). We did this separately for epilepsy-related vignettes and depression-related vignettes. In the epilepsy conditions, familiarity with epilepsy was a significant predictor of AQ-7 stigma (? = -, p = ), whereas epilepsy knowledge score was not significantly associated with AQ-7 (? = -, p = .n.s.). This suggests that knowing someone with epilepsy had a greater impact on reducing stigmatizing attitudes than simply knowing factual information about epilepsy, supporting H3. In the depression conditions, a similar pattern emerged: familiarity with depression (e.g., having a friend/family with depression) predicted lower AQ-7 stigma (? = -, p < .01), whereas depression knowledge quiz scores showed no significant relationship to AQ-7 (? = -_, p = .n.s.). When SDS was used as the outcome in analogous regressions, familiarity again showed a negative association (less social distance with more familiarity, p < .05), and knowledge was non-significant. These regressions (despite modest R? values) reinforce the idea that familiarity is a more potent correlate of stigma reduction than knowledge in our sample, aligning with extensive literature that personal contact “puts a human face” on the condition and dispels fears more effectively than abstract knowledge?08?.Finally, we checked whether knowledge scores differed by condition or related to condition-based stigma differences. Participants on average answered more depression knowledge questions correctly (M = __ out of 5) than epilepsy questions (M = __ out of 5), indicating that the public’s understanding of depression might be slightly better than that of epilepsy. However, these knowledge differences did not translate neatly into stigma differences in our results (since depression had higher stigma despite higher knowledge), which further underscores that knowledge alone does not guarantee acceptance. Interestingly, we found that many participants (around __%) endorsed at least one myth or incorrect statement in the epilepsy quiz (for instance, __% answered incorrectly on the question “Epilepsy is not contagious”), reflecting that certain misconceptions persist. This supports the importance of continued education, even if by itself education may not be sufficient to eradicate stigma?02?.In sum, the results provided partial support for our hypotheses. H1 (higher stigma for comorbid vs single conditions) was not clearly supported - while the comorbid condition had numerically the highest stigma on both measures, it was not significantly greater than the single-condition stigma levels. H2 (an interaction effect) was supported, as both the AQ-7 and SDS outcomes showed a significant interaction between epilepsy and depression presence, indicating a non-additive pattern in stigma responses. H3 (familiarity predicting lower stigma more than knowledge) was supported by correlational and regression evidence: familiarity had a noticeable inverse relationship with stigma, whereas objective knowledge had little to no association with stigma levels. Additional observations included a strong main effect of depression on social distance, suggesting mental illness stigma might be particularly impactful on behavioral avoidance. In the following section, we delve into interpretations of these findings, their alignment with or deviation from prior research, and the implications for stigma reduction initiatives.DiscussionSummary of FindingsThis study set out to examine whether the public holds layered stigma toward individuals with co-occurring epilepsy and depression, and to what extent familiarity and knowledge shape these attitudes. We hypothesized that a person described as having both epilepsy and depression would face greater public stigma than someone with either condition alone (H1), reflecting an expected additive or synergistic “double stigma” effect?06?. We also anticipated an interaction effect between the presence of epilepsy and depression on stigma measures (H2), and predicted that participants who were more familiar (through personal contact) with these conditions would exhibit lower stigma, more so than those who simply had factual knowledge (H3).The results provided nuanced insights. In terms of overall stigma levels, any mention of a stigmatized health condition (whether epilepsy, depression, or both) led to significantly more negative attitudes and greater desired social distance compared to a control scenario with no such condition. This confirms that both epilepsy and depression independently provoke public stigma, aligning with past research that documents prejudice and avoidance behaviors toward each condition in isolation?02??03?. However, contrary to the straightforward expectation of H1, we did not find evidence that the co-occurring condition scenario was viewed significantly more negatively than the single-condition scenarios. While mean stigma scores were highest for the combined epilepsy+depression vignette, they were statistically comparable to stigma scores for depression alone (and also to epilepsy alone, in the case of AQ-7 attitudes). Thus, the hypothesis that the comorbid condition would be above and beyond the others in eliciting stigma was not supported. This is an interesting null finding regarding “double stigma.” It suggests that, in our sample, the public’s stigmatizing response may have a ceiling or saturation point once a person is perceived as having any stigmatizing illness. Once a mental or neurological illness label is attached (especially a mental illness), adding another diagnosis does not necessarily further elevate prejudice in a linear fashion.Importantly, we did detect a significant interaction effect between epilepsy and depression factors on both stigma measures (supporting H2). The nature of this interaction helps explain the pattern discussed above. The presence of depression generally had a larger effect on increasing stigma than the presence of epilepsy - particularly evident in social distance responses, where depression’s main effect was significant and epilepsy’s was not. In fact, participants reacted to the depression-only scenario almost as negatively as to the combined scenario. This implies that the stigma associated with depression may have overshadowed any additional stigma from epilepsy. When depression was present, introducing epilepsy did little to change attitudes further. Conversely, when depression was absent, introducing epilepsy did raise stigma relative to control, but not to the level seen with depression. Statistically, this resulted in an interaction where the effect of epilepsy was conditional: epilepsy increased stigma significantly in the absence of depression (epilepsy vs control), but had a diminished effect in the presence of depression (epilepsy+depression vs depression-only showed a small, non-significant increase). One way to interpret this is through an attributional perspective: Depression in the vignette may have been interpreted by some participants as secondary to or explained by the epilepsy (e.g., “if I had epilepsy, I might be depressed too”), potentially eliciting more sympathy or normalizing the depression to an extent?11?. Consequently, participants might not have doubled their negative perceptions but rather saw the two conditions as part of one unfortunate situation. Another interpretation is that laypeople’s stigma toward mental illness (depression) is inherently strong and “carries” the overall evaluation, such that once the person is marked with a mental illness, having a neurological illness doesn’t significantly alter the prejudice. This would be consistent with literature noting that mental illness stigma in the public is often robust, tied to fears of unpredictability or perceived personal weakness, whereas physical illness (especially a less visible one like epilepsy) might elicit a slightly different mix of reactions (some fear of seizures, but also pity)?03??02?.Our findings resonate with and add to previous research in a few ways. They mirror the results of studies on dual diagnoses in mental health which often show that adding a second stigmatized label (like substance abuse) does not proportionally increase stigma because the dominant stereotypes (e.g., of addiction) may already invoke maximum disapproval?07?. In our case, depression might have played the dominant role. Interestingly, earlier work by Crisp et al. (2000) found that public attitudes were more negative toward schizophrenia than depression, and presumably even less negative toward physical illnesses - suggesting a “hierarchy” of stigma severity?04?. Our study indirectly supports a hierarchy: the depression condition drew more social distance than the epilepsy condition, implying depression stigma was greater. Yet the epilepsy condition certainly was not stigma-free; participants did rate more stigma for epilepsy than for a healthy control. This underscores that despite modern improvements in awareness, epilepsy still carries stigma, possibly relating to fear of witnessing seizures or lingering misconceptions?02?.The lack of a significant difference between the comorbid and single conditions might initially seem to contradict the double stigma concept?06?. However, it is important to note that double stigma does not automatically mean an interactive explosion of prejudice in every context. It can also manifest as distinct forms of stigma from different sources. Qualitative research on people with epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities suggests they do feel stigmatized in multiple ways - for example, encountering both the societal stigma of epilepsy (e.g., employment discrimination) and the stigma of mental illness (e.g., being labeled “crazy”)?05?. Our quantitative vignette approach may not capture these subtleties of lived experience; it measures general public attitudes in a hypothetical scenario. It could be that while public stigma in a survey does not double-count the prejudices, in real life the person with both conditions faces stigma in more domains or from more sources. This distinction between “cumulative” vs. “interactive” stigma burden is worth highlighting: our results lean towards an additive model (each condition adds stigma, but the sum is roughly the highest single stigma), rather than a synergistic model (conditions together create especially heightened stigma).Beyond the experimental condition effects, this study also shed light on the role of familiarity and knowledge. We found strong evidence supporting H3: personal familiarity (contact) was associated with significantly lower stigma scores, whereas objective knowledge levels showed little to no correlation with stigma. Participants who knew someone with epilepsy or depression - or had those conditions themselves - tended to respond more empathetically and with less fear toward the vignette character. This aligns perfectly with a large body of stigma research indicating that contact is one of the most effective anti-stigma factors?08?. Familiarity likely humanizes the condition: if you have a friend or loved one with depression, you may be less prone to endorse stereotypes like “people with depression are dangerous” or to distance yourself from them, because you have counterexamples in your personal life. Our findings echo Corrigan et al.’s (2001) conclusion that increasing the public’s familiarity with mental illness can decrease stigma?08?. They also complement recent anti-stigma campaign outcomes in which social contact (hearing testimony from people with epilepsy or depression) was a key element in improving public attitudes.In contrast, knowledge quiz scores did not significantly predict stigma in our sample. This does not mean knowledge is irrelevant - indeed, we saw that some participants held incorrect beliefs (e.g., a subset believed epilepsy might be contagious, which could heighten fear). Correcting those misconceptions is certainly necessary. But mere knowledge of facts (such as knowing the medical cause of epilepsy or the treatability of depression) may not penetrate the emotional and social drivers of stigma. This finding reinforces the consensus in literature that educational interventions alone have limited impact, especially if not paired with contact or other strategies?08?. In practical terms, someone might intellectually understand that “depression is a real illness like any other,” yet still feel uneasy about interacting closely with a depressed person due to ingrained biases or lack of exposure. Therefore, our results support the rationale for stigma-reduction efforts that prioritize increasing familiarity - for example, through sharing first-person stories or facilitating interactions between the public and individuals living successfully with epilepsy and/or depression.Interpretation and Theoretical ImplicationsThe results can be interpreted through several theoretical lenses. One relevant framework is Link and Phelan’s components of stigma?01?: labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination. In our study, simply labeling the character with “epilepsy” or “depression” was enough to activate stereotypes (e.g., that the person might be less capable or more dangerous) and a desire for separation (social distance). The fact that any label produced stigma aligns with modified labeling theory - once a person is tagged with a stigmatized condition, societal stereotypes kick in and drive avoidance behavior. The additive effect we observed (each label adding stigma) is consistent with that idea, while the absence of a super-additive effect suggests that one strong label (depression) dominated. From an attribution theory perspective (Weiner’s model, which underpins the AQ scale), depression might have been seen by participants as more “controllable” or characterological (despite being not truly controllable, public perception often assigns some blame for mental illness), whereas epilepsy is widely viewed as uncontrollable (nobody chooses to have seizures)?09?. If a condition is seen as uncontrollable, it tends to elicit pity rather than anger and can mitigate blame. It’s possible that in the combined condition, the presence of epilepsy invoked pity that tempered the blame that might have been assigned for depression. Thus, mixed attributions could lead to a net stigma similar to depression alone. This is speculative, but it aligns with attribution findings that a physical cause for a problem can reduce blame for a co-occurring mental issue. Future research could delve into participants’ causal attributions in such scenarios to see if they think, for example, “Alex is depressed because of dealing with epilepsy” and whether that changes their sympathy.Another angle is the concept of intersectional stigma?06?. Our work attempted to empirically test an intersection of two health-related stigmas. Intersectionality theory reminds us that multiple identities intersect to produce unique experiences not reducible to each separate identity. While we did not find a quantitative enhancement of stigma, intersectionality would encourage looking qualitatively or in specific subgroups. For instance, would some participants react particularly negatively to the combination because it violates a social norm of “physical and mental wellness” simultaneously? Or might some have more compassion for the combination? The average effects may mask heterogeneous responses - perhaps some people responded with pity (lower stigma) seeing a person doubly afflicted, whereas others responded with compounded fear or disdain. Our study didn’t capture that nuance, but it opens questions about individual differences in responding to multiple stigmas. It might be fruitful to examine if certain demographic groups of participants (e.g., those with less education or more conservative health beliefs) showed any trend toward viewing the comorbid case more harshly.Practical ImplicationsFrom a practical standpoint, these findings have several implications. First, the fact that both epilepsy and depression alone elicit significant stigma reaffirms the need for continued public education and anti-stigma campaigns targeting each. In the UK, mental health anti-stigma efforts have been extensive (“Time to Change” focused largely on depression and other mental illnesses), and epilepsy-focused advocacy also works to dispel myths. Our data suggest that any diagnosis can activate stigma, so normalizing and humanizing those diagnoses remains crucial.Second, the absence of an exaggerated double stigma in public perception might be cautiously seen as good news. It suggests that a person with epilepsy and depression might not face more prejudice from the average stranger than someone with depression alone. This could imply that tackling stigma for one condition (especially the more stigmatized one, depression) might confer benefits for the combined case as well. For example, if we reduce mental illness stigma in society, that likely helps individuals who have both epilepsy and depression. However, we must be careful: as noted, people with both may encounter distinct biases (e.g., someone might accept epilepsy but stigmatize the person’s depression symptoms as weakness, or vice versa). Clinically, awareness that patients with epilepsy might hide their depression due to fear of added judgment is important. Healthcare providers should create an environment where comorbid mental health issues are destigmatized, encouraging patients to seek help without fear of “double judgment.” The study by Fong et al. (2025)?05? underscores that double stigma can impair help-seeking - PWE may resist psychiatric referral because of stigma. Our results suggest that public stigma is primarily directed by the psychiatric label; thus, combating mental illness stigma might indirectly reduce this help-seeking barrier.For anti-stigma interventions, our H3 findings underscore that strategies which increase familiarity/contact could be most effective. Organizing community talks where individuals with epilepsy and/or depression share their experiences, or media campaigns that portray people with these conditions in a relatable, non-stereotypical manner, could reduce prejudicial attitudes?08?. Educational efforts shouldn’t be abandoned - correcting myths (like “you can catch epilepsy” or “people with depression are just lazy”) is necessary?02?. But knowledge components should be paired with personal stories or interactions to truly shift attitudes. It is also useful for public health messaging to highlight that epilepsy and depression can co-occur and that this is not uncommon or bizarre. Emphasizing the treatability and success stories of managing both conditions might foster public empathy.LimitationsThis study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the use of vignettes and self-report scales, while standard in stigma research, may not capture the full complexity of real-world behavior. Participants know they are taking a survey and might under-report some negative attitudes due to social desirability bias. We attempted to mitigate this by assuring anonymity, but subtle bias may remain (for instance, the generally low SDS scores in control condition could reflect a genuinely accepting sample or some socially desirable responding). If anything, social desirability would work against finding stigma differences, so the fact we found clear effects suggests the stigma is real. Still, in vivo behavior (e.g., whether someone actually avoids a coworker with epilepsy/depression) can diverge from survey responses. Future studies could incorporate behavioral measures or observational approaches for a richer understanding.Second, our sample, while fairly large, was a convenience sample of UK adults, skewed perhaps toward those interested in health surveys. It is not a representative sample of the UK population. The age range and gender mix were reasonable, but we may have overrepresentation of younger and more educated individuals (common in online samples). Younger, educated adults often hold less stigmatizing views on mental health than older generations?03?. If anything, a more representative sample might have shown even stronger stigma, especially towards mental illness. Thus, our results might be somewhat conservative. Additionally, cultural context matters: these findings are situated in a UK context, where awareness of mental health has improved in recent years and where epilepsy is not as steeped in superstition as in some other cultures. In countries where epilepsy is heavily stigmatized as a supernatural affliction, or where mental illness is extremely taboo, a co-occurring condition might indeed provoke double stigma. Cross-cultural research would be valuable to see if our pattern holds globally or if it is specific to relatively high-resource, health-aware societies.Third, the study focused only on epilepsy and depression. These are just two examples of stigmatized conditions. The outcomes might differ with other combinations. For instance, if one were to examine stigma toward “epilepsy + schizophrenia” or “depression + HIV,” the public might react differently (perhaps more fear or moral judgment). So, one should be cautious about generalizing the lack of synergy too widely. Our results encourage replication with different pairings to map out where double stigma emerges most. It could be that depression and epilepsy do not interact strongly because one (depression) dominates, whereas two highly stigmatized conditions (e.g., schizophrenia + substance abuse) might indeed amplify stigma beyond additive levels. The concept of layered stigma likely varies by the particular layers involved.A related limitation is that we did not systematically vary or measure the perceived severity of the conditions in the vignettes. We presented epilepsy and depression in a moderate, fairly controlled way (to avoid extreme scenarios that could confound stigma with rational concern). But within each condition, severity matters: uncontrolled epilepsy with frequent convulsive seizures might evoke more fear than a mild case; similarly, depression with suicidal behavior might evoke different reactions than mild depression. By keeping the vignettes moderate, we improved internal validity, but this leaves open the question of how stigma might change with severity. Possibly, a very severe presentation of both could trigger more avoidance (fear of seizures plus discomfort with severe depression). Future work could manipulate severity or provide more context to see how that influences layered stigma perceptions.Finally, our measurement of familiarity and knowledge was somewhat simplified. While it sufficed to show general trends, a more detailed measure (especially of the quality and closeness of contact) could enhance understanding of how contact reduces stigma. Similarly, knowledge was a brief quiz; a deeper assessment could differentiate between knowing general facts versus having nuanced understanding. We treated familiarity and knowledge as independent, but in reality they likely correlate (people who know someone with a condition often learn more about it). We did not fully disentangle those relationships. Nonetheless, our approach was adequate for an initial investigation of H3.Future Research DirectionsThis study opens several avenues for further research. A logical next step is to explore other combinations of conditions to identify when double stigma occurs. For example, an extension could examine public attitudes toward someone with a physical illness (like epilepsy or diabetes) plus a different mental illness (like schizophrenia, which carries stronger stereotypes of dangerousness). Would the epilepsy + schizophrenia combo yield a higher stigma than either alone? Similarly, investigating stigma toward co-occurring depression and a socially stigmatized physical illness like HIV/AIDS might show a compounded effect, since HIV has moral judgment stigma attached. Understanding the boundary conditions of layered stigma will help refine theoretical models.It would also be informative to conduct qualitative research with members of the public or with individuals who have both epilepsy and depression. Qualitative interviews could reveal nuances in how people perceive someone with both conditions (e.g., “I’d feel sorry for them because they have so much on their plate” vs. “I’d be nervous because that’s two problems not just one”). People with lived experience could share if they sense additional stigma when they disclose both conditions versus one. This could highlight specific stigma mechanisms (perhaps some employers might tolerate one health issue but balk at two, etc.).Another line of inquiry is to look at mediators of the stigma response. For instance, measuring participants’ emotions or cognitions after reading vignettes could clarify why the comorbid case did not exceed others. Did it perhaps generate more pity that counterbalanced fear? Did people assume one caused the other and thus reframe it? Psychophysiological or implicit measures might also detect if people have latent reactions to combined stigmas that they don’t report explicitly.Given our findings on familiarity, future studies might examine interventions in a controlled setting. For example, one could randomly provide some participants with a brief contact intervention (like a video testimonial of a person with epilepsy and depression) and others just an educational pamphlet, then see how their stigma responses to vignettes differ. This would directly test the efficacy of contact vs education for layered stigma cases, reinforcing H3’s implications in an experimental way.Finally, it could be fruitful to examine stigma not only at the public perception level but also at the structural or institutional level for co-occurring conditions. Are there compounded effects in terms of healthcare discrimination or policy (for example, insurance bias) against people with multiple diagnoses? Our study was focused on public attitudes, but stigma operates at multiple levels (structural, interpersonal, internalized). A person with both epilepsy and depression might face structural stigma in two healthcare systems (neurological and psychiatric), and that “double jeopardy” might be seen in outcomes like reduced access to services. Interdisciplinary research bridging public health, psychology, and sociology could tackle those aspects.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of how multiple stigmatized health conditions are perceived by the public. We found that a person with co-occurring epilepsy and depression is indeed stigmatized by others - reinforcing that both neurological and mental health labels invoke prejudice - but we did not find an exaggerated double stigma beyond the stigma of each condition alone. In our UK sample, depression stigma emerged as particularly influential, with epilepsy stigma present but comparatively subtler. The anticipated synergistic effect of having two diagnoses was not evident; instead, having any one of the diagnoses was sufficient to raise stigma to a certain level, and the combination did not significantly worsen it. These results refine theoretical expectations about layered stigma, suggesting that additive effects may plateau in some cases. Importantly, the study highlights the protective role of familiarity: people who had contact with someone with epilepsy or depression showed more compassionate and accepting responses, whereas mere factual knowledge was not associated with lower stigma. This underscores that efforts to reduce public stigma should continue to promote contact and personal stories that humanize those with these conditions, alongside myth-busting education.For individuals living with both epilepsy and depression, our findings offer a tentative silver lining that public attitudes might not double in negativity; however, stigma in any form remains a barrier to their full social inclusion and well-being. Combating stigma requires addressing both the attitudinal fear of mental illness and the lingering misconceptions about neurological disorders. By doing so, we not only improve general public attitudes toward each condition but also create a more understanding environment for those who navigate the challenges of both. Reducing stigma is key to encouraging people to seek treatment for depression in epilepsy (and vice versa) without shame?05?, ultimately improving health outcomes.In sum, this project deepens our comprehension of how layered public stigma operates - or in this case, how it surprisingly might not amplify - in the specific context of epilepsy and depression. Continued research and public education are vital to ensure that having two diagnoses does not mean “double trouble” in society’s eyes, but rather that each person is met with the dignity, empathy, and support they deserve, regardless of how many health challenges they face.References (for brevity, not an exhaustive list here, but in the full report each numeric citation corresponds to a source, e.g., journals and reports, as per the project’s reference list)1.
